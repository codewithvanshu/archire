        Welcome to Archire, a platform designed to bridge the gap between
        clients and architects. Our mission is to streamline the process of
        project discovery, application, and collaboration, making it easier for
        clients to find talented architects and for architects to showcase their
        skills.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        With Archire, clients can post project details, review applications from
        architects, and communicate directly through our messaging system.
        Architects can explore opportunities, submit proposals, and manage their
        project engagementsâ€”all in one place.
      </p>
